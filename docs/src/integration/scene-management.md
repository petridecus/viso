# Scene Management

Viso's structural state lives in `molex::Assembly`, which is owned by
**your** application — not by viso. Viso is a pure consumer: you push
the latest `Arc<Assembly>` to the engine via
[`VisoEngine::set_assembly`], and the engine drains the snapshot on
the next sync tick and rederives its render state.

There is no "group" abstraction in viso — every entity lives directly
in the `Assembly` and is identified by an opaque `EntityId`.

## Pushing Assembly Snapshots

```
┌──────────────────────┐                          ┌─────────────────┐
│   your application   │   Arc<Assembly>          │   VisoEngine    │
│                      │ ─engine.set_assembly──►  │                 │
│  molex::Assembly     │                          │  pending slot   │

└──────────────────────┘                          └─────────────────┘
```

- Your application mutates its `molex::Assembly` (using molex's APIs)
  and calls `engine.set_assembly(Arc::new(self.assembly.clone()))`.
- `VisoEngine::update(dt)` drains the pending snapshot; if its
  generation differs from the last applied one, the engine rederives
  its per-entity state and submits a full-rebuild request to the
  background mesh processor.

That's the entire structural ingest contract for library users. There
is no viso-defined channel, publisher, or consumer in the public API.

## Mutating the Scene

You mutate `molex::Assembly` through molex's own APIs and re-publish
to viso after each batch of changes:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use molex::Assembly;
use viso::{Transition, VisoEngine};

// 1. Mutate the assembly however you like.
let mut assembly = /* your owned Assembly */;
assembly.add_entity(new_entity);
assembly.update_positions(eid, &new_coords);
// ... add/remove/update as needed ...

// 2. Push the new snapshot. Cheap: Arc<Assembly> is shared
//    by reference.
engine.set_assembly(Arc::new(assembly.clone()));

// 3. (Optional) For entities whose positions changed, queue a
//    per-entity transition so the next sync animates instead of
//    snapping. Without this, the engine snaps to the new state.
engine.set_entity_behavior(entity_id, Transition::smooth());
```

The next `engine.update(dt)` drains the pending snapshot, rederives
the scene, and submits a full-rebuild to the background mesh
processor. Mesh generation happens off-thread, so the main thread is
not blocked.

## Engine-Side Annotations

Some per-entity state is purely a viso concern (it doesn't belong on
the molecular structure itself). Those live on
`EntityAnnotations`, mutated through engine methods:

```rust
// Animation behavior overrides (keyed by EntityId, not raw u32).
let eid = engine.entity_id(raw_id).expect("known entity");
engine.set_entity_behavior(eid, Transition::collapse_expand(/* ... */));
engine.clear_entity_behavior(eid);

// Per-entity appearance overrides (drawing mode, color scheme,
// helix/sheet style, surface kind, palette, etc.).
let mut overrides = DisplayOverrides::default();
overrides.color_scheme = Some(ColorScheme::SecondaryStructure);
engine.set_entity_appearance(eid, overrides);
engine.clear_entity_appearance(eid);
```

`set_entity_appearance` diffs against the previous overrides and
dispatches only the invalidations that matter — a `surface_kind`
change triggers surface regeneration, a `color_scheme` change triggers
color recomputation, and so on.

## Looking Up Entities

The engine exposes a small read-only surface for looking entities up:

```rust
// Translate a raw u32 (from IPC, TOML, CLI) to an opaque EntityId.
let eid: Option<EntityId> = engine.entity_id(raw_id);

// Walk the current Assembly snapshot directly.
for entity in engine.assembly().entities() {
    println!("{:?}: {}", entity.id(), entity.molecule_type());
}

// Total entity count.
let n = engine.entity_count();
```

`entity_id` is the canonical "boundary translator" — wire formats
carry raw `u32` ids; viso-internal APIs use `EntityId`. Translate
once at the boundary and pass `EntityId` through.

## Focus

Focus determines what the camera follows and what the user is
"working on". It cycles through entities with `Tab`:

```rust
pub enum Focus {
    Session,             // All visible entities (default)
    Entity(EntityId),    // A specific entity
}
```

```rust
// Cycle: Session → Entity₁ → … → EntityN → Session
engine.execute(VisoCommand::CycleFocus);

// Focus a specific entity by raw id.
engine.execute(VisoCommand::FocusEntity { id });

// Reset to session-wide focus.
engine.execute(VisoCommand::ResetFocus);

// Read current focus state.
let focus: Focus = engine.focus();
let focused_entity: Option<EntityId> = engine.focused_entity();
```

## What Happens During Sync

When a new `Assembly` snapshot arrives:

1. **Rederive per-entity state.** For each entity, the engine builds
   render-ready derived data (backbone chains, sidechain topology, SS
   types, residue color metadata).
2. **Submit a `FullRebuild`.** The background processor receives a
   `Vec<FullRebuildEntity>` plus the active display, color, and
   geometry options. Per-entity mesh caching means only entities whose
   `mesh_version` changed are regenerated.
3. **Triple-buffer the result.** When the processor finishes, the
   resulting `PreparedRebuild` is written to a triple buffer.
4. **Apply on the next frame.** `engine.update(dt)` calls
   `apply_pending_scene`, which uploads the GPU buffers in a memcpy
   and rebuilds picking bind groups.

The main thread never blocks. If the new meshes aren't ready by the
next frame, the previous frame's data continues to render until they
are.
