# Introduction

Viso is a GPU-accelerated 3D protein visualization engine built in Rust on
top of [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/). It powers the molecular graphics in
Foldit, rendering proteins, ligands, nucleic acids, and constraint visualizations at interactive frame
rates.

Viso is designed as an **embeddable library** -- you give it a window or
surface, feed it structure data, and it produces a 2D texture. The host
decides what to do with that texture: display it in a winit window, paint it
onto an HTML canvas, write it to a PNG, or drop it into a dioxus/egui
texture slot.

```rust
use viso::Viewer;

Viewer::builder()
    .with_path("1ubq")           // PDB code or local .cif/.pdb/.bcif path
    .with_title("My Viewer")
    .build()
    .run()?;
```

## Features

**Rendering**

- Ribbons, tubes, ball-and-stick, capsule sidechains, nucleic acid backbones
- Ray-marched impostors for pixel-perfect spheres and capsules at any zoom
- Post-processing pipeline -- SSAO, bloom, FXAA, depth-based outlines, fog, tone mapping

**Interaction**

- Arcball camera with animated transitions, panning, zoom, and auto-rotate
- GPU picking -- click to select residues, double-click for SS segments, triple-click for chains, shift-click for multi-select

**Animation**

- Smooth interpolation, cascading reveals, collapse/expand mutations
- Per-entity targeted animation with configurable behaviors

**Performance**

- Background mesh generation on a dedicated thread with triple-buffered results
- Per-group mesh caching -- only changed groups are regenerated
- Lock-free communication between main and background threads

**Configuration**

- TOML-serializable options for display, lighting, color, geometry, and camera
- Load/save presets, per-section diffing on update

## How It Works
